                    "Confidential Information" means any proprietary information
                    disclosed by one party ("Discloser") and received by the
                    other party ("Recipient") during, or prior to entering into,
                    this Agreement that Recipient should know is confidential or
                    proprietary based on the circumstances surrounding the
                    disclosure. Confidential Information includes the Invicti
                    Security Products and any non-public technical and business
                    information. Confidential Information does not include
                    information that (i) is or becomes generally known to the
                    public through no fault of or breach of this Agreement by
                    Recipient; (ii) is rightfully known by Recipient at the time
                    of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality;
                    (iii) is independently developed by Recipient without use of
                    Discloser's Confidential Information; or (iv) Recipient
                    rightfully obtains from a third party without restriction on
                    use or disclosure. Recipient will maintain the
                    confidentiality of Confidential Information, and Recipient
                    agrees not to use such Confidential Information for any
                    purpose except as necessary to fulfill its obligations and
                    exercise its rights under this Agreement. Recipient will
                    protect the secrecy of and prevent disclosure and
                    unauthorized use of Discloser's Confidential Information
                    using the same degree of care that it takes to protect its
                    own confidential information and will in no event use less
                    than reasonable care. Recipient may disclose Discloser's
                    Confidential Information if required by judicial or
                    administrative process, provided that Recipient first
                    provides Discloser with prompt notice of such required
                    disclosure to enable the Discloser to seek a protective
                    order. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement and
                    Discloser's request, Recipient will promptly return or
                    destroy (and provide written certification of such
                    destruction) Discloser's Confidential Information.

                    Partner Pricing. Unless otherwise agreed on an Order Form
                    between Invicti Security and Partner, the price for the
                    Products – including any upgrades and support – shall be the
                    price provided by the applicable distributor. This discount
                    will be subject to review at the end of each term in Invicti
                    Security's discretion. The currency to be utilized in this
                    Agreement is that determined by the terms and conditions of
                    the online price list quoted on the Invicti Security
                    website.

                  <li>
                    Orders. To the extent that Invicti Security make Products
                    available for resale, Partner may order such Products for
                    resale to End Users by following the directions set forth in
                    the Portal or the Program Guide or as otherwise provided for
                    by the applicable distributor. Prior to providing the
                    Products to an End User, Partner will deliver to Invicti
                    Security or the applicable distributor a purchase order
                    detailing: End User name, location and email address of the
                    Reseller Client; the Product and number of items being
                    ordered; the Product fee; the payment terms for the Product
                    fee; and any other material commercial provision in relation
                    to said End User ("Order"). Invicti Security will consider
                    such Order, and if it approves the same it will notify
                    Partner of the delivery by electronic means. While Invicti
                    Security shall use reasonable commercial efforts to meet
                    delivery and supply times, Partner's only remedy for
                    unreasonable delay in supplying Products will be the right
                    to terminate this Agreement after service of notice of
                    breach as provided for elsewhere in this Agreement.

                  <li>
                    Taxes. Partner must pay all Taxes arising out of the
                    transactions contemplated by the Agreement. Here "Taxes"
                    means any sales, VAT (value-added tax), GST (goods and
                    services tax), use, gross receipts, business and occupation,
                    and other taxes (other than taxes on our income), export and
                    import fees, customs duties, and similar charges imposed by
                    any government or other authority.

                  <li>
                    Payment Terms. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, Partner's
                    non-refundable, non-cancelable payment is due when Partner
                    submits its Order. The method of payment shall be by means
                    of wire transfer. Each party is to pay his own bank charges.
                    Invicti Security may charge interest on overdue invoices
                    from the date when payment of the invoice becomes due for
                    payment up to and including the date of actual payment. In
                    the event of non-payment, Invicti Security shall have the
                    right to suspend performance under this agreement and/or
                    terminate this Agreement.

                  <li>
                    End User Pricing. Partner will independently set its own
                    pricing to each End User. Partner bears all risk of
                    non-payment by End Users and is solely responsible for all
                    of its costs and expenses. Unless otherwise agreed in
                    writing, Partners agrees not to post any Invicti Security
                    provided price list on its website even if such price list
                    is displayed publicly on the Invicti Security website.
                    Partner may not terminate an Order or receive any refunds
                    due to non-payment by an End User. If Invicti Security
                    provides any refund to an End User under its limited
                    warranty provision or otherwise under the End User
                    Agreement, Invicti Security, at its option, will refund the
                    applicable amounts either directly to the End User or to
                    Partner for distribution to the End User. Partner agree to
                    cooperate with Invicti Security in connection with any such
                    refund.

                    or failures in the performance of its obligations under this

                    Agreement in exercising any right, power, or privilege
                    hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
                    single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
                    further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right,
                    power, or privilege hereunder at law or equity.

                    this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder
                    to a third party without the written consent of Invicti
                    Security, except that Partner may, without such consent,

                    and assets, whether by merger, sale of assets, sale of

                    will be null and void. Invicti Security may freely assign or
